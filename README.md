# AVnPy

This is an alternative version of [vnpy/vnpy](https://github.com/vnpy/vnpy). It is entirely for personal purpose. If you like the changes I made, it would be great!

## Target:

1. Port to Python3.
2. Port to Qt5 for QtChart pkg.
3. x64 support for all components.
4. Remove the dependence to Anaconda as it doesn't support QtChart yet.
5. Write code for hist data importing
